# SuperSecretPassword
Example iOS Application To Demonstrate Simple Security Concepts To Young Children.

## Description:
Each level shows a picture that hints at the password needed to move to the next level.
The final level will show a picture with many different items in the picture which makes
it difficult to guess what the password can be. At this point we can disassemble the app
and search for strings and filter for password. This shows the students an example use
of disassemblers.
